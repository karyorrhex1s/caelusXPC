# caelusXPC
caelusXPC is a comprehensive security monitoring tool designed to detect and respond to suspicious activities on a system. It provides both real-time monitoring and on-demand security checking capabilities to protect against unauthorized system changes and potentially malicious activities.

## Core Functionality
### Basic Security Monitoring
- **System Status Checks**: Performs system-wide security checks to detect suspicious activities
- **Process Monitoring**: Tracks process information including command line arguments and user context
- **Integrity Verification**: Verifies the integrity of the executable and source files to detect tampering
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security events with automated log rotation

### Operational Modes
- **Single Check Mode**: Performs a one-time system security check and exits
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runs as a daemon, constantly monitoring for security events
- **Configurable Intervals**: Set custom intervals for monitoring cycles

### Cross-Platform Support
- Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS with platform-specific implementations
- Adapts monitoring techniques to each platform's architecture

### Configuration System
- JSON-based configuration file stored in user's home directory
- Default configuration automatically created if none exists
- Command-line flags to override configuration settings

## Advanced Security Features (Available as Placeholders)
### Cryptographic Integrity Protection
- **File Signatures**: Adds cryptographic signatures to critical files
- **Tamper Detection**: Verifies signatures to detect unauthorized modifications
- **Trust Chain**: Establishes a chain of trust for executable and configuration files

### Real-Time File System Monitoring
- **File Change Notifications**: Receives immediate notifications of file system changes
- **Rapid Response**: Reduces the time between a change and detection/response
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Monitors all critical system and application files

### Memory Protection
- **Memory Canaries**: Places canaries in critical memory regions to detect tampering
- **Memory Checksumming**: Verifies memory integrity through periodic checksums
- **Runtime Protection**: Detects attempts to modify the program during execution

### Anomaly Detection
- **Behavioral Baseline**: Establishes baseline measurements of normal system behavior
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identifies deviations from normal patterns
- **Learning Capability**: Adapts to legitimate changes in system behavior over time

### Backup and Recovery
- **Critical File Backups**: Creates periodic backups of critical files
- **Automated Recovery**: Restores tampered files from secure backups
- **Version History**: Maintains history of file versions for forensic analysis

### External Alerting
- **Multiple Channels**: Supports email, SMS, and webhook notifications
- **Alert Filtering**: Configurable thresholds for different alert types
- **Response Integration**: Can integrate with external security response systems

- ## Usage
### Basic Commands
``` 
# Run a single security check
./caelusXPC

# Run in continuous monitoring mode
./caelusXPC -continuous

# Set custom monitoring interval
./caelusXPC -continuous -interval 1m

# Reset integrity database
./caelusXPC -reset-integrity

# Skip integrity checking
./caelusXPC -skip-integrity
```
### Advanced Security Features
``` 
# Enable real-time file monitoring
./caelusXPC -real-time-monitoring

```
## Configuration
The configuration file is automatically created at `~/security_monitoring/configs/config.json` with these default settings:
- **Log Directory**: `~/security_monitoring/logs`
- **Monitor Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Max Log Size**: 10 MB
- **Max Log Age**: 7 days
- **Alert Threshold**: 0.8 (80% confidence for alerts)
- **Integrity Check**: Enabled by default

Advanced security options are disabled by default and can be enabled via configuration or command-line flags.
## Directory Structure
- **~/security_monitoring/logs**: Log files
- **~/security_monitoring/configs**: Configuration files including integrity database
- **~/security_monitoring/bin**: Additional binaries or scripts
- **~/security_monitoring/backups**: Backups of critical files (when backup feature is enabled)

## Extending the Tool
The tool is designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension:
1. **Security Checks**: Add new security check functions to detect additional threat vectors
2. **Platform Support**: Extend platform-specific implementations
3. **Alert Channels**: Add new notification methods
4. **Security Policies**: Customize response actions for different threat types

## Future Development Roadmap
1. **Real-time File Monitoring**: Full implementation using fsnotify
2. **Digital Signatures**: Complete cryptographic signature system
3. **Advanced Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based detection
4. **Network Security**: Expanded network traffic monitoring
5. **User Interface**: Web-based dashboard for monitoring and configuration
6. **Distributed Monitoring**: Centralized monitoring of multiple systems

## Security Considerations
- The tool runs with the permissions of the user who executes it
- Some features may require elevated permissions on certain platforms
- Always keep the tool updated to ensure protection against the latest threats
- Consider using environment variables like `BYPASS_INTEGRITY=1` only for legitimate troubleshooting
